                <p><b>Mayhaemsters</b> is a competitive multiplayer game for up to four players where players control hamsters on paper airplanes as they fly around on a continuously morphing beach while trying to shoot each other down with the goal of being the last hamster alive.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, randomly appearing items can be used to influence the controls of your enemy players.</p>
                <p>For instance, one of the more striking items cause the four major player abilities – namely <i>Attack</i>, <i>Dash</i>, <i>Use Item</i> and <i>Self-Destruct</i> - to be remapped to different action buttons over and over again.</p>
                <p>With that, it is not possible to fully rely on your own controls in the same way as provided by typical video game conventions.</p>
                <p>Mayhaemsters is for players looking for a fun, dynamic and unique action experience that can be shared with your friends and families.</p>
